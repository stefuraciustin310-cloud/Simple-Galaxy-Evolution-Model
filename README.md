# Simple-Galaxy-Evolution-Model

This project implements a simplified time-dependent simulation model to study how key system properties evolve over time under different input assumptions and feedback mechanisms.

Using externally provided arbitrary growth histories as input data, the model tracks the evolution of multiple interacting quantities through numerical integration and compares the simulated results with known empirical scaling relationships. The project focuses on data preprocessing, numerical methods and model validation.

Data Sources:

    - Publicly available time-series tables containing growth histories for multiple systems, generated by a public software that is described in van den Bosch et al. [2014].
    - Dark Matter Halos with virial mass between 10 and 13 (logarithmic) have been considered.
Methodology:

    - Data Preprocessing

        Loaded tabular time-series data from multiple files

        Converted time variables into a consistent reference frame

        Interpolated irregularly sampled data onto a uniform time grid

        Verified preprocessing by visual inspection of interpolated trends

    - Numerical Simulation

        Implemented a system of coupled differential equations describing the evolution of: total mass, resource reservoir and output production rate

        Solved the equations numerically using an explicit time-stepping (Euler) method

        Ensured numerical stability by enforcing physical constraints (non-negative quantities, for example)

    - Feedback Modeling

        Introduced feedback mechanisms that regulate system growth based on system size

        Modeled feedback strength using tunable parameters

        Explored how feedback alters long-term system behavior and output efficiency

    - Parameter Exploration

        Performed a manual parameter search to identify combinations that reproduce expected trends

        Compared simulation outputs across multiple parameter settings

        Evaluated model sensitivity to feedback strength and scaling assumptions
